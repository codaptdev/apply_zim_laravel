            <br><br>

            <p>
                One question that parents and students alike have to ask when moving to the next level of education
                is where to next? I remember when I had finished my grade 7, I didn't know <strong>where to even start looking</strong> for a new
                school to begin my high school journey. I was so limited to the schools in my home town and a few I knew outside and as
                a result I ended up <strong>enrolling to a school I didn't want to go to</strong>. I regreted that descision but fortunately I transfered
                to a different school later on. The moral of my short little story is that the descion for which school to enroll in is a very
                <strong>important choice</strong> to make in life both for you and your parents/gaurdians.

                <br><br>

                I deliberately Highlighted some phrases in the paragraph above because these are the problems that ApplyZim seeks to solve. ApplyZim solves the need
                for the need of a central place to start looking, at the same time, it provides a pool of schools allowing you to make
                informed descisons because we know that its an important descision for you to make.
